-Ensure issue is assgined to someone, milestone is set and due date added (where possible)
-All changes made should be done on a new branch. Ideally bracnh should be made directly from issue page
-Changes and commits should be made as normal 
-Before pushing, master should be pulled 
-Resolve any merge conflicts
-Then create merge request 
-Someone else should read and aprrove code, before branch is merged
-Useful commit message should be added in merging, use close #issue_number or fixes #issue_number to close revelant issues
